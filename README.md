## Technologies

#### Web-Pack

In this project, I utilized modules with ES6 Modules syntax. Modules are necessary to segment JavaScript files for specific tasks. This is essential for ease of editing and readability of the JavaScript code. Otherwise, however, you might find it unpleasant to read and edit a JavaScript file with 20,000 lines or more. I also used babel and core-js polyfills as a module. Now my project can work not only on the latest browser versions but also on older ones.

## Installation

To use this project, you'll need to:

Clone this project to your computer using the command (git clone https://github.com/Waterfallllllll/Food.git your_folder)
Next, download all npm packages. 

## Usage

To ensure the project runs smoothly, we need to start certain technologies:

If you wish to edit or add something, start gulp.
You'll also need to have openserver for the submission of data from the modal windows to work. The openserver mimics the functioning of a real hosting environment.
