## Technologies

#### Web-Pack

In this project, I utilized modules with ES6 Modules syntax. Modules are necessary to segment JavaScript files for specific tasks. This is essential for ease of editing and readability of the JavaScript code. Otherwise, however, you might find it unpleasant to read and edit a JavaScript file with 20,000 lines or more. I also used babel and core-js polyfills as a module. Now my project can work not only on the latest browser versions but also on older ones.
